## riva: rare and indicator visualization and analysis

A package for the analysis of indicator species and the rare biosphere in microbiome research. Most functionality of the package exists as separate scripts from recent analysis pipelines and manuscripts. _riva_ is an effort to consolidate this research.

The name, _riva_ (Italian: bank, shore), is also a loose reference to Darwin's "_entangled bank_".
